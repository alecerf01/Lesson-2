    <p>Hi, my name is Alex, I was born in the Seychelles, not that I remember it as I left when I was 2 years old. I've lived all over the world, travelling fairly frequently because of my parents work. I am half French and hald English. I can also speak Spanish and some Japanese, though lots of it has been lost from lack of practice.</p>
    <p>A little bit about me, I love reading both books and manga, with a wide range of genres that I enjoy. My favourite being epic fantasy, where the series span over 4 books. In my spare time I enjoy watching anime and spending time with my friends.</p>
    <p>I look forward to completing this course and learning how to code.</p>
